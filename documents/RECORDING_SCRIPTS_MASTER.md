# 🟢 BEGINNER STREAM SCRIPTS

## M1-L1: What AI Actually Is
**Target Length**: 2-3 minutes  
**Tone**: Professional, demystifying, encouraging  

---

### 🎬 1. Intro (Face to Camera) - 0:00 to 0:20
**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen. Friendly & Direct.

**Script**:  
> "Hi, I'm Jimmy. Welcome to the Maru AI Academy.  
> If you've watched sci-fi movies, you might think AI is this magic robot brain that can do anything—or maybe take your job.  
> But let's cut through the hype.  
> In this first lesson, I want to show you what modern AI *actually* is, and why it's about to become the most powerful productivity tool in your toolkit.  
> Let's dive in."

---

### 🧠 2. The Concept: Pattern Matching - 0:20 to 1:00
**Visual**: Animation of a person reading a library of books. Then show a phone keyboard "predicting" the next word.

**Script**:  
> "At its core, tools like ChatGPT and Gemini are Large Language Models (LLMs).  
> Think of them as 'Autocomplete on Steroids'.  
> They have read billions of documents—books, websites, articles—and learned the *patterns* of human language.  
> When you ask a question, it's not 'thinking' like a human. It's calculating, with incredible accuracy, which word comes next."

---

### 💡 3. The Metaphor: The Brilliant Intern - 1:00 to 1:45
**Visual**: Split screen. Left side: A stressed expert. Right side: An eager intern with a stack of files.

**Script**:  
> "The best way to think about AI today is like hiring a **Brilliant, but Junior, Intern**.  
> They have read every book in the library (they're smart).  
> But they don't know your specific business context (they're junior).  
> If you give them a vague instruction like 'Do the report', they will fail.  
> But if you give them clear instructions, context, and examples, they will produce work in seconds that would take you hours."

---

### 🚀 4. Practical Takeaway - 1:45 to 2:15
**Visual**: Screen recording showing a simple prompt input and output. Text overlay: "Garbage In = Garbage Out".

**Script**:  
> "This brings us to the golden rule of AI: **Quality of Input determines Quality of Output.**  
> If you treat it like a magic search engine, you'll get generic, boring answers.  
> If you treat it like a collaborative partner and guide it, you'll get gold.  
> We call this skill **Prompt Engineering**, and that is exactly what you are going to master in this course."

---

### 👉 5. Outro (Face to Camera) - 2:15 to 2:30
**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen.

**Script**:  
> "So, don't worry about the robots taking over yet.  
> Focus on learning the patterns.  
> In the next step below, I want you to write your very first professional prompt using the playground.  
> Give it a try, and I'll see you in the next lesson."

---

## M1-L2: Tool Categories
**Target Length**: 3 minutes  
**Tone**: Clarity, Organization, Practical  

---

### 🎬 1. Intro (Face to Camera) - 0:00 to 0:30
**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen.

**Script**:  
> "Hi there.  
> One of the biggest reasons people get overwhelmed by AI is simply *choice paralysis*.  
> There are thousands of tools launching every week.  
> ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Midjourney, Jasper... it's a lot.  
> In this lesson, I'm going to simplify the entire landscape into just **Four Categories**.  
> Once you understand these four buckets, you'll know exactly which tool to grab for any job."

---

### 🖥️ 2. Screen Share: The 4 Categories - 0:30 to 2:00
**Visual**: Screen Share of a slide/diagram showing 4 quadrants or columns.

**Script**:  
> "Here is your mental map for the AI world.  
>  
> **Category 1: Text & Analysis (The 'Brain')**  
> This is ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Use these for writing emails, summarizing reports, brainstorming ideas, or coding. If it involves words or logic, start here.  
>  
> **Category 2: Image & Visuals (The 'Artist')**  
> This is Midjourney, DALL-E, or Canva Magic. Use these when you need a slide background, a social media post, or a mockup. They don't 'read' text well, but they 'draw' beautifully.  
>  
> **Category 3: Audio & Video (The 'Studio')**  
> Tools like ElevenLabs (for voice) or HeyGen (for avatars). They turn text into multimedia. Great for content creation, but not for daily office admin.  
>  
> **Category 4: Automation (The 'Glue')**  
> This is where it gets powerful. Tools like Zapier or Make. They connect the 'Brain' to your email or Slack. We'll cover this in the Intermediate course."

---

### 🔍 3. Live Demo: Choosing the Right Tool - 2:00 to 2:45
**Visual**: Show ChatGPT interface, then flip to Midjourney Discord (or Canva).

**Script**:  
> "Let's say you need to launch a new product.  
> You'd go to **ChatGPT** (Category 1) to write the press release.  
> Then, you'd go to **Canva** (Category 2) to design the flyer.  
> Don't try to get ChatGPT to draw the flyer—it's not built for that.  
> Using the right tool for the job is 90% of the battle."

---

### 👉 4. Outro (Face to Camera) - 2:45 to 3:00
**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen.

**Script**:  
> "So, for your next task, I'm going to give you a few real-world scenarios.  
> I want you to tell me: Which category of AI would you hire?  
> Jump into the challenge below, and I'll see you in the next video."

---

## M1-L3: Data Safety & POPIA
**Target Length**: 3 minutes  
**Tone**: Serious but practical. "Security Enabler," not "Blocker."  

---

### 🎬 1. Intro (Face to Camera) - 0:00 to 0:45
**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen.

**Script**:  
> "Hi. Before we start writing powerful prompts, we need to have 'The Talk'.  
> AI Models like ChatGPT learn from the data they are trained on.  
> Depending on which version you use, they might also learn from *the data you type into them*.  
> This means if you paste a client's ID number or your company's financial forecast into a public AI tool... you might basically be publishing it.  
> In South Africa, with POPIA laws, that's a massive risk.  
> But don't panic. You don't need to stop using AI. You just need to follow the **Golden Rule of Sanitization**."

---

### 🖥️ 2. Screen Share: The Red & Green Lists - 0:45 to 2:00
**Visual**: Slide showing two columns: "NEVER SHARE" (Red) and "SAFE TO SHARE" (Green).

**Script**:  
> "Here is your safety checklist.  
> **The Red List (Never Paste):**  
> 1. **Personal Identifiers**: ID numbers, Passport numbers, Employee numbers.  
> 2. **Contact Details**: Real emails, phone numbers, addresses of clients.  
> 3. **Authentication**: Passwords, API keys, Login credentials.  
> 4. **Confidential Strategy**: Unreleased product plans, financial results, legal disputes.  
>  
> **The Green List (Safe):**  
> 1. Generic processes.  
> 2. Public marketing copy.  
> 3. Anonymized data (Client X, Project Y).  
> 4. Code snippets that don't reveal business logic."

---

### 🔍 3. Live Demo: Sanitization in Action - 2:00 to 2:45
**Visual**: Screen recording of a text editor or AI chat.

**Script**:  
> "Let's look at this prompt:  
> *'Summarize the contract for John Smith, ID 850101...' No! Stop!*  
> This is a data breach waiting to happen.  
> Here is how we fix it. We use **Placeholders**.  
> Change 'John Smith' to '[Client Name]'.  
> Change the ID to '[ID Number]'.  
> Now paste *that* into the AI.  
> The AI can still understand the context and write the summary perfectly, but you haven't exposed anyone's privacy."

---

### 👉 4. Outro (Face to Camera) - 2:45 to 3:00
**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen.

**Script**:  
> "It's a simple habit: **Sanitize before you Synthesize.**  
> In the challenge below, I've got a messy, unsafe prompt waiting for you.  
> Your job is to act as the Privacy Officer and fix it.  
> Go make it safe."

---

## M1-L4: The CRAFT Framework

**Tone**: Empowering, specific, technical but accessible  

---

### 🎬 1. Intro (Face to Camera) - 0:00 to 0:45
**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen.

**Script**:  
> "Have you ever tried AI and got a boring, generic answer?  
> Maybe you asked 'Write an email about the project,' and it sounded like a robot wrote it.  
> The problem isn't the AI. It's the **Context**.  
> AI is a brilliant intern, but it can't read your mind.  
> Today I'm going to teach you the **CRAFT Framework**.  
> It stands for Context, Role, Action, Format, and Tone.  
> Use this pattern, and you will get top-tier results every single time."

---

### 🖥️ 2. Screen Share: The Framework Breakdown - 0:45 to 2:00
**Visual**: Slide with the acronym C-R-A-F-T. Highlighting each letter as spoken.

**Script**:  
> "Let's break it down:  
> **C - Context**: Set the scene. 'I am launching a new coffee brand.'  
> **R - Role**: Who should the AI be? 'Act as a Senior Marketing Director.'  
> **A - Action**: What exactly do you need? 'Write 5 slogans.'  
> **F - Format**: How should it look? 'A bulleted list, short and punchy.'  
> **T - Tone**: What's the vibe? 'Energetic, hipster, fun.'"

---

### 🔍 3. Live Demo: Bad vs. Good Prompt - 2:00 to 3:30
**Visual**: Screen recording of ChatGPT/Claude.

**Script**:  
> "Let's try the bad version first.  
> Prompt: *'Write slogans for coffee.'*  
> Result: 'Wake up fresh.' 'Best coffee in town.' ... Boring. Generic.  
>  
> Now let's apply CRAFT.  
> Prompt: *'I'm launching a high-caffeine coffee for programmers (Context). Act as a edgy tech copywriter (Role). Write 5 slogans (Action). Format as a Tweet (Format). Tone is witty and geeky (Tone).'*  
> Result: 'Coffee.compile(success).' 'Debug your morning.'  
> See the difference? It's night and day."

---

### 👉 4. Outro (Face to Camera) - 3:30 to 3:45
**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen.

**Script**:  
> "That is the power of prompt engineering.  
> You guide the outcome by setting the constraints.  
> In the interactive exercise below, I want you to build a full CRAFT prompt for a specific business scenario.  
> Master this, and you've mastered 80% of AI."

---

**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen.

**Script**:  
> "Hi. In Module 1, you wrote your first prompts. That's great.  
> But if you are writing a fresh prompt from scratch every single time you need an email... you are doing it wrong.  
> That is the rookie way.  
> The *Pro* way is **Template Thinking**.  
> Today I'm going to show you how to turn your best prompts into reusable assets that you—and your whole team—can use forever.  
> It's the difference between being a craftsman and running a factory."

---

### 🖥️ 2. Screen Share: The Anatomy of a Template - 0:45 to 2:00
**Visual**: Slide showing "Fixed vs Variable".

**Script**:  
> "A normal prompt is rigid: *'Write an email to John about the budget.'*  
> A Template is flexible.  
> It has **Fixed Parts** (the instructions that never change) and **Variable Parts** (the specific details).  
> We use **[Square Brackets]** to mark the variables.  
> So it becomes: *'Write a [TONE] email to [RECIPIENT] about [TOPIC].'*  
> Now, you don't have to think about the prompt. You just fill in the blanks."

---

### 🔍 3. Live Demo: Creating a Template - 2:00 to 2:45
**Visual**: Text Editor.

**Script**:  
> "Let's build one.

> Prompt: *'Act as a busy executive. Write a polite decline to [SALESPERSON NAME] who wants to sell [PRODUCT]. Explain that we are [REASON FOR DECLINE], but keep the door open for [FUTURE DATE].'*  
> Now, whenever a salesperson emails you, you just paste this in, fill the brackets, and hit generate.

>  
> **Step 4: Distributing.**  
> *'Now write a LinkedIn post and a Twitter thread to promote this article.'*

---

### 🖥️ 2. Screen Share: The SOP Engine - 0:40 to 2:00
**Visual**: Screen Share.

**Script**:  
> "Here is the trick.  
> Instead of writing a manual from scratch, do the task *one last time* and record a rough transcript or just bullet points of what you did.  
> Then we prompt:  
> *'Act as an Operations Manager. Detailed below feels messy notes on how I generate the monthly invoice. Turn this into a step-by-step SOP formatted for a junior employee. Include a checklist.'*

5. AI answers.

**Script**:  
> "Here is the workflow.  
> When you ask 'What is our policy on remote work?', the vanilla ChatGPT doesn't know. It hallucinates.  
> With RAG, your system first searches your documents. It finds the 'HR Handbook 2025.pdf'.  
> It takes that page and sends it to the AI saying: 'Using this document, answer the question.'  
> The result? An accurate answer based on *your* truth, not the internet's training data."

### 👉 3. Outro (Face to Camera) - 2:00 to 2:15
**Visual**: Jimmy.

**Script**:

> We need structured data."

---

### 🖥️ 2. Screen Share: The Clean Data Structure - 0:40 to 2:00
**Visual**: Comparison of Messy Folder vs Clean Q&A List.

**Script**:  
> "AI struggles with 50-page PDFs full of images and jargon.  
> It *loves* clearly formatted text.  
> The best way to prepare your data is to create **Q&A Documents**.  
> Take your messy handbook and convert it into a list of 'Question: [X] / Answer: [Y]'.  
> This gives the AI bite-sized chunks of truth to retrieve.  
> We call this 'Knowledge Management', and it's the foundation of the AI era."

**Script**:  
> "We have talked about Chatbots (Text).  
> Now let's talk about **Connectors**.  
> Tools like Zapier or Make.com allow different apps to talk to each other *without you*.  
> When a lead fills a form on your website → Send them an email → Add row to spreadsheet → Alert Slack.  
> This is called an Automation or a 'Zap'.  
> And when you combine this with AI, you can build entire businesses that run on autopilot."

> **A - Action**: Do this... (e.g., 'Use ChatGPT to summarize it').  
> **C - Check/Connect**: Send it here... (e.g., 'Post summary to Slack').  
> Let's build a simple one right now.  
> Trigger: New Lead.  
> Action: AI drafts a personalized welcome email.  
> Action: Save to Google Sheets as 'Draft'.  
> Now, I just wake up and approve the drafts. I don't write them."

---

### 👉 3. Outro (Face to Camera) - 2:30 to 2:45
**Visual**: Jimmy.

**Script**:  
> "Warning: Once you start automating, it becomes addictive.

### 🎬 1. Intro (Face to Camera) - 0:00 to 0:45
**Visual**: Jimmy.

**Script**:  
> "Automations are great... until they break.  
> And they *will* break.  
> Maybe the internet goes down. Maybe a client types a weird character. Maybe the AI hallucinates.  
> If you build a robot that sends emails automatically, and it breaks, you could spam 1,000 clients in a minute.  
> That is why real professionals obsess over **Error Handling**."

---

### 🖥️ 2. Screen Share: Human in the Loop - 0:45 to 2:00
**Visual**: Diagram: AI -> Draft -> Human Review -> Send.

**Script**:  
> "The golden rule for beginners: **Human in the Loop**.  
> Never let an AI send a message to a human entirely on its own.  
> Make the automation create a *Draft*.  
> You review the draft. You hit 'Send'.  
> This takes 5 seconds, but it saves your reputation.  
> Only remove the human loop once the system has run perfectly for 100 times in a row."

---

### 👉 3. Outro (Face to Camera) - 2:00 to 2:15
**Visual**: Jimmy.

**Script**:
