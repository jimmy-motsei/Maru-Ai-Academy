**Audio**: 
"The unsexy secret of high-performance teams is **Documentation**.
But nobody has time to write SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures).
The good news? AI loves writing SOPs.
We are going to use AI to document your own job, so you can hand off the lower-value work and focus on strategy."

## 🖥️ 2. Screen Share: The SOP Engine (0:40 - 2:00)
**Visual**: Screen Share.

**Audio**: 
"Here is the trick.
Instead of writing a manual from scratch, do the task *one last time* and record a rough transcript or just bullet points of what you did.
Then we prompt:
*'Act as an Operations Manager. Detailed below feels messy notes on how I generate the monthly invoice. Turn this into a step-by-step SOP formatted for a junior employee. Include a checklist.'*
[PASTE MESSY NOTES]
Look at that. It creates a professional manual in seconds."
