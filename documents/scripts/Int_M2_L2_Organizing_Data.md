## 🎬 1. Intro (Face to Camera) - 0:00 to 0:40
**Visual**: Jimmy.
**Audio**: 
"Here is the hard truth about AI: **Garbage In, Garbage Out**.
If your company shared drive is a mess of unnamed folders and 'Final_Final_V3.docx', RAG won't save you.
Before we build cool bots, we need to tidy up our room.
We need structured data."

## 🖥️ 2. Screen Share: The Clean Data Structure (0:40 - 2:00)
**Visual**: Comparison of Messy Folder vs Clean Q&A List.

**Audio**: 
"AI struggles with 50-page PDFs full of images and jargon.
It *loves* clearly formatted text.
The best way to prepare your data is to create **Q&A Documents**.
Take your messy handbook and convert it into a list of 'Question: [X] / Answer: [Y]'.
This gives the AI bite-sized chunks of truth to retrieve.
We call this 'Knowledge Management', and it's the foundation of the AI era."

This simple step makes it instantly ready for a Chatbot."
