## 🎬 1. Intro (Face to Camera) - 0:00 to 0:45
**Visual**: Jimmy.
**Audio**: 
"We have talked about Chatbots (Text).
Now let's talk about **Connectors**.
Tools like Zapier or Make.com allow different apps to talk to each other *without you*.
When a lead fills a form on your website → Send them an email → Add row to spreadsheet → Alert Slack.
This is called an Automation or a 'Zap'.
And when you combine this with AI, you can build entire businesses that run on autopilot."

## 🖥️ 2. Screen Share: The TAC Framework (0:45 - 2:30)
**Visual**: Zapier Interface.

**Audio**: 
"Every automation follows the **TAC** Framework:
**T - Trigger**: When this happens... (e.g., 'New Email arrives').
**A - Action**: Do this... (e.g., 'Use ChatGPT to summarize it').
**C - Check/Connect**: Send it here... (e.g., 'Post summary to Slack').
Let's build a simple one right now.
Trigger: New Lead.
Action: AI drafts a personalized welcome email.
Action: Save to Google Sheets as 'Draft'.
Now, I just wake up and approve the drafts. I don't write them."

## 👉 3. Outro (Face to Camera) - 2:30 - 2:45
**Visual**: Jimmy.
**Audio**: 
"Warning: Once you start automating, it becomes addictive.
Start small. Don't try to automate your whole job on day one.
Pick one repetitive notification you hate, and automate it."
