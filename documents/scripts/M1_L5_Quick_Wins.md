## 🖥️ 2. Screen Share: Rapid Fire Demos (0:30 - 2:00)
**Visual**: Screen recording. Very fast transitions between 3 examples.

**Audio**: 
"**Win #1: The Email Polisher.**
Don't stare at a draft. Write a messy brain dump, then tell AI: *'Rewrite this to be professional, polite, and concise.'* Boom. Sent.

**Win #2: The Slide Outliner.**
Blank page syndrome? Gone.
Tell AI: *'Create a 5-slide outline for a presentation on Q3 Sales Results. Include bullet points for each slide.'*
Suddenly, you have a structure to work from.

**Win #3: The Meeting Summarizer.**
Paste your messy notes. Tell AI: *'Extract the 3 Key Decisions and the Action Items table.'*
You look like the most organized person in the room."

## 🏆 3. The Graduation (2:00 - 2:30)
**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen. Maybe holding a 'prop' badge or just smiling.
**Audio**: 
"And just like that, you have completed Module 1: AI Made Simple.
You are no longer a spectator. You are a practitioner.
You've earned your **Trainee Pilot** badge.
In Module 2, we’re going to go deeper into 'Prompts That Work at Work' and build reusable templates.
But for now, give yourself a hand. You’re flying.
See you in Module 2."
