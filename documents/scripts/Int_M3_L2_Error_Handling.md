## 🎬 1. Intro (Face to Camera) - 0:00 to 0:45
**Visual**: Jimmy.
**Audio**: 
"Automations are great... until they break.
And they *will* break.
Maybe the internet goes down. Maybe a client types a weird character. Maybe the AI hallucinates.
If you build a robot that sends emails automatically, and it breaks, you could spam 1,000 clients in a minute.
That is why real professionals obsess over **Error Handling**."

## 🖥️ 2. Screen Share: Human in the Loop (0:45 - 2:00)
**Visual**: Diagram: AI -> Draft -> Human Review -> Send.

**Audio**: 
"The golden rule for beginners: **Human in the Loop**.
Never let an AI send a message to a human entirely on its own.
Make the automation create a *Draft*.
You review the draft. You hit 'Send'.
This takes 5 seconds, but it saves your reputation.
Only remove the human loop once the system has run perfectly for 100 times in a row."

## 👉 3. Outro (Face to Camera) - 2:00 - 2:15
**Visual**: Jimmy.
**Audio**: 
"Safety first.
In this lesson, we'll design a 'Circuit Breaker'—a way to stop your automation instantly if things go wrong.
Let's build safetly."
