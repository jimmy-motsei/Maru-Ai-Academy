## 🎬 1. Intro (Face to Camera) - 0:00 to 0:45
**Visual**: Jimmy.
**Audio**: 
"Imagine if you could hire ChatGPT, but it knew everything about *your* company.
It knew your price list, your employee handbook, and your past emails.
That is called **RAG** (Retrieval Augmented Generation).
It sounds complex, but it's simple: It's giving the AI an open-book exam, where the 'book' is your company data."

## 🖥️ 2. Screen Share: How RAG Works (0:45 - 2:00)
**Visual**: Simple animation or slide.
1. User asks question.
2. System searches "Company Library".
3. System finds relevant page.
4. System sends Question + Page to AI.
5. AI answers.

**Audio**: 
"Here is the workflow.
When you ask 'What is our policy on remote work?', the vanilla ChatGPT doesn't know. It hallucinates.
With RAG, your system first searches your documents. It finds the 'HR Handbook 2025.pdf'.
It takes that page and sends it to the AI saying: 'Using this document, answer the question.'
The result? An accurate answer based on *your* truth, not the internet's training data."

## 👉 3. Outro (Face to Camera) - 2:00 - 2:15
**Visual**: Jimmy.
**Audio**: 
"You don't need to be a coder to use this.
Tools like ‘Chat with PDF’ or ‘Custom GPTs’ do this for you.
In this module, we’ll build your own mini-knowledge base."
