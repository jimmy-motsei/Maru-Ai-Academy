## 🎬 1. Intro (Face to Camera) - 0:00 to 0:45
**Visual**: Jimmy.
**Audio**: 
"Welcome to the Intermediate Stream.
In the Beginner course, we focused on *Personal Productivity*—how YOU can write better emails and reports.
Now, we are shifting to *Systems Thinking*.
The goal isn't just to make *you* faster. It's to make your *entire process* repeatable, scalable, and delegation-ready.
We are moving from 'Random Acts of AI' to 'AI Operations'."

## 🖥️ 2. Screen Share: Ad-Hoc vs System (0:45 - 2:00)
**Visual**: Slide: "Ad-Hoc" (Messy squiggles) vs "System" (Clean flowchart).

**Audio**: 
"Most people use AI in 'Ad-Hoc' mode. 
They wake up, face a problem, and throw a random prompt at it.
That works once. But you can't delegate it.
A **System** has three parts:
1.  **Trigger**: What starts the work? (e.g., A client email arrives).
2.  **Protocol**: The exact steps and templates used (The 'Standard Operating Procedure').
3.  **Output**: A consistent result every time.
If you can't draw your process as a flowchart, you can't automate it with AI."

## 👉 3. Outro (Face to Camera) - 2:00 - 2:15
**Visual**: Jimmy.
**Audio**: 
"In this module, we're going to take your messy, random tasks and turn them into documented systems.
Let's start mapping."
