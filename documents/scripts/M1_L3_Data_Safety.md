# Video Script: Module 1, Lesson 3 - Data Safety & POPIA
**Target Length**: 3 minutes
**Tone**: Serious but practical. "Security Enabler," not "Blocker."

## 🎬 1. Intro (Face to Camera) - 0:00 to 0:45
**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen.
**Audio**: 
"Hi. Before we start writing powerful prompts, we need to have ' The Talk'.
AI Models like ChatGPT learn from the data they are trained on.
Depending on which version you use, they might also learn from *the data you type into them*.
This means if you paste a client's ID number or your company's financial forecast into a public AI tool... you might basically be publishing it.
In South Africa, with POPIA laws, that’s a massive risk.
But don't panic. You don't need to stop using AI. You just need to follow the **Golden Rule of Sanitization**."

## 🖥️ 2. Screen Share: The Red & Green Lists (0:45 - 2:00)
**Visual**: Slide showing two columns: "NEVER SHARE" (Red) and "SAFE TO SHARE" (Green).

**Audio**: 
"Here is your safety checklist.
**The Red List (Never Paste):**
1.  **Personal Identifiers**: ID numbers, Passport numbers, Employee numbers.
2.  **Contact Details**: Real emails, phone numbers, addresses of clients.
3.  **Authentication**: Passwords, API keys, Login credentials.
4.  **Confidential Strategy**: Unreleased product plans, financial results, legal disputes.

**The Green List (Safe):**
1.  Generic processes.
2.  Public marketing copy.
3.  Anonymized data (Client X, Project Y).
4.  Code snippets that don't reveal business logic."

## 🔍 3. Live Demo: Sanitization in Action (2:00 - 2:45)
**Visual**: Screen recording of a text editor or AI chat.

**Audio**: 
"Let's look at this prompt:
*'Summarize the contract for John Smith, ID 850101...' No! Stop!*
This is a data breach waiting to happen.
Here is how we fix it. We use **Placeholders**.
Change 'John Smith' to '[Client Name]'.
Change the ID to '[ID Number]'.
Now paste *that* into the AI.
The AI can still understand the context and write the summary perfectly, but you haven't exposed anyone's privacy."

## 👉 4. Outro (Face to Camera) - 2:45 - 3:00
**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen.
**Audio**: 
"It's a simple habit: **Sanitize before you Synthesize.**
In the challenge below, I've got a messy, unsafe prompt waiting for you.
Your job is to act as the Privacy Officer and fix it.
Go make it safe."
