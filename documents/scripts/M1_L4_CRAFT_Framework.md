## 🎬 1. Intro (Face to Camera) - 0:00 to 0:45
**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen.
**Audio**: 
"Have you ever tried AI and got a boring, generic answer? 
Maybe you asked 'Write an email about the project,' and it sounded like a robot wrote it.
The problem isn't the AI. It's the **Context**.
AI is a brilliant intern, but it can't read your mind.
Today I'm going to teach you the **CRAFT Framework**.
It stands for Context, Role, Action, Format, and Tone.
Use this pattern, and you will get top-tier results every single time."

## 🖥️ 2. Screen Share: The Framework Breakdown (0:45 - 2:00)
**Visual**: Slide with the acronym C-R-A-F-T. Highlighting each letter as spoken.

"Let's break it down:
**C - Context**: Set the scene. 'I am launching a new coffee brand.'
**R - Role**: Who should the AI be? 'Act as a Senior Marketing Director.'
**A - Action**: What exactly do you need? 'Write 5 slogans.'
**F - Format**: How should it look? 'A bulleted list, short and punchy.'
**T - Tone**: What's the vibe? 'Energetic, hipster, fun.'"

## 🔍 3. Live Demo: Bad vs. Good Prompt (2:00 - 3:30)
**Visual**: Screen recording of ChatGPT/Claude.

**Audio**: 
"Let’s try the bad version first.
Prompt: *'Write slogans for coffee.'*
Result: 'Wake up fresh.' 'Best coffee in town.' ... Boring. Generic.

Now let's apply CRAFT.
Prompt: *'I'm launching a high-caffeine coffee for programmers (Context). Act as a edgy tech copywriter (Role). Write 5 slogans (Action). Format as a Tweet (Format). Tone is witty and geeky (Tone).'*
Result: 'Coffee.compile(success).' 'Debug your morning.'
See the difference? It's night and day."

**Visual**: Jimmy, Full Screen.
**Audio**: 
"That is the power of prompt engineering.
You guide the outcome by setting the constraints.
In the interactive exercise below, I want you to build a full CRAFT prompt for a specific business scenario.
Master this, and you've mastered 80% of AI."
